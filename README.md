# sheetsync
SheetSync seamlessly bridges Excel and Git, enabling true version control for spreadsheets. It automatically converts Excel files to human-readable JSON for diffing and merging, then restores them to native Excel format for editing. No more binary conflicts, lost formulas, or overwritten work.
