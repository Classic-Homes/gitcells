# TUI Improvements Summary

## Overview
The GitCells TUI has been redesigned with a consistent, modern interface that's easier to navigate and more efficient to use.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Unified Dashboard**
- **Before**: Separate Status Dashboard and Watcher screens
- **After**: Combined into one dashboard with tabs (Overview, Files, Activity)
- **Benefits**: See all important information at a glance, less navigation

### 2. **Consistent Navigation**
Applied across ALL screens:
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Switch between tabs/sections
- `↑↓` or `j/k` - Navigate lists
- `Enter` - Select/confirm
- `Esc` - Always goes back (no more confusion between q/esc)
- `q` - Always quits from any screen

### 3. **Quick Action Bar**
Every screen now has a bottom action bar showing:
- Context-specific quick actions with keyboard shortcuts
- Current navigation help
- Consistent styling and positioning

### 4. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
All screens show where you are:
- Example: `Dashboard › Settings › Git`
- Always know your location in the app
- Consistent header styling

### 5. **Improved Settings**
- **Before**: Long list of settings in one view
- **After**: Organized into tabs (General, Git, Watcher, Advanced)
- **Benefits**: Easier to find settings, better organization

### 6. **Enhanced Error Logs**
- Clean list view with timestamps and levels
- Color-coded log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Quick filters and search
- Detailed view for full error information

### 7. **Visual Consistency**
- Unified color scheme using defined styles
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Professional appearance

## Implementation Details

### New Components Created:
1. **actionbar.go** - Reusable action bar component
2. **unified_dashboard.go** - Combined dashboard model
3. **settings_v2.go** - Redesigned settings with tabs
4. **error_log_v2.go** - Enhanced error log viewer
5. **app_v2.go** - Simplified app structure

### Design Principles:
- **Reduce Navigation Depth**: Start in dashboard, not menu
- **Global Shortcuts**: Quick actions available from any screen
- **Consistent UX**: Same keys work everywhere
- **Information Density**: Show more useful info per screen
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to terminal size

## Usage

The new TUI is now the default:
```bash
gitcells tui
```

To use the classic menu-based TUI:
```bash
gitcells tui --v2=false
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Workflow** - Quick actions reduce navigation time
2. **Better Context** - Always know where you are and what you can do
3. **Reduced Learning Curve** - Consistent patterns across all screens
4. **Professional Appearance** - Modern, polished interface
5. **Improved Accessibility** - Clear visual hierarchy and keyboard navigation
